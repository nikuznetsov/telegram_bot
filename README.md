Telegram bot which is realization of program [array_processing.ipynb](https://github.com/nikuznetsov/code_examples/blob/master/array_processing.ipynb "array_processing.ipynb").

This program is used to solve a scientific problem. There is a program for calculating electric fields, but it has poor visualization. But, fortunately, from this program you can get an array of data in a special format. This program is used to process this array and visualize the data in a visual format.

This bot differs from the program in the way that there is no function for cropping part of image.
